# Deep-Instance-Segmentation-of-Teeth-on-Dental-X-rays-using-U-Nets
Automatic tooth detection and segmentation has been an important research topic of image analysis in dentistry for at least the last two decades. In this paper, a post-processing stage is proposed to obtain a segmentation map that differentiates the objects in an image, and we use the U-Net network to apply this approach to tooth
